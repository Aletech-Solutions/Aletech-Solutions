### OwlClock

OwlClock is one of the funniest projects that i'm working on, it's going to be a Realtime platform, where you fight other players with questions about a specific topic, but with a lot of crazy tricks that you can do to "cheat" in this knowlegde race. The Stack is full javascript, using react-native for mobile, and Node with socket.io in the backend.
