I’m Alexandre Vieira.

I’m a software engineer with around nine years of experience in the industry. Over the years, I’ve worked with small startups, large tech companies, banks, and investment funds, gaining exposure to a wide range of problems, scales, and engineering cultures.

Some of my repositories make use of AI, others don’t. I use the right tools for the job. If you’re not a fan of AI, that’s fine, but it won’t change how I build.

I’m also deeply interested in self-hosting. I’ve been running and building my own infrastructure and tools for years, and I don’t plan on stopping anytime soon.

That’s what you need to know about me.
